    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of Crush-TLDR ("the App"), operated by ShumbaBrown ("we", "our"). By using the App, you agree to these Terms.</p>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the App for any unlawful purpose.</li>

    <h2>5. Flight Data and Pricing</h2>
    <p>Flight prices, schedules, and availability displayed in the App are provided by third-party data sources (Amadeus) and are subject to change without notice. We do not guarantee the accuracy, completeness, or availability of any flight information. The App is an informational tool — all bookings are made through external airlines or travel agencies.</p>
    <p><strong>We are not a travel agency and do not sell airline tickets.</strong> We are not responsible for any booking decisions you make based on information shown in the App.</p>

    <h2>6. Activity Recommendations</h2>

    <h2>7. Partner Pairing</h2>
    <p>The partner pairing feature allows two users to share trip data and plans. By pairing with another user, you consent to sharing your name, home city, airport code, and trip plans with that person. You can unpair at any time from the Settings screen.</p>

    <h2>8. Push Notifications</h2>
    <p>If you enable push notifications, we may send you alerts about price changes, trip reminders, and partner activity. You can disable notifications at any time in your device settings or in the App.</p>

    <h2>9. Intellectual Property</h2>

    <h2>11. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>The App is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, express or implied. We do not warrant that the App will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of harmful components.</p>

    <h2>13. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify you of significant changes through the App. Your continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
