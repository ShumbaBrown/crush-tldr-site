    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: February 11, 2026</p>

    <p>Crush-TLDR ("we", "our", or "the App") is operated by Yard &amp; Y'all Technologies. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your choices regarding your data.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

    <p><strong>Account information:</strong> When you create an account, we collect your email address (or phone number), display name, home city, and preferred airport code(s). If you sign in with Google or Apple, we receive your name and email from those providers.</p>

    <p><strong>Travel preferences:</strong> Preferred travel days, trip duration, cabin class, price limits, and stop preferences you set in the app.</p>

    <p><strong>Partner pairing:</strong> When you pair with a partner, we store partner IDs and a couple identifier to enable shared features like trip planning and countdowns.</p>

    <p><strong>Trip and activity data:</strong> Planned trips, saved flight watchlists, trip itineraries, and activity recommendations you save or complete.</p>

    <p><strong>Device and diagnostic data:</strong> When you submit feedback, we collect device type, operating system version, app version, current screen, and a log of recent in-app events (navigation and API calls) to help us diagnose issues. We do not collect this data at any other time.</p>

    <p><strong>Push notification tokens:</strong> If you enable notifications, we store your device push token to send price alerts and trip reminders.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>We do not collect or store passwords (authentication is handled by Firebase Authentication).</li>
      <li>We do not collect location data or GPS coordinates.</li>
      <li>We do not read your contacts, photos, or messages.</li>
      <li>We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third parties for advertising purposes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>

      <li>To provide and personalize flight search results and visit recommendations.</li>
      <li>To enable partner pairing and shared trip planning features.</li>
      <li>To send push notifications for price drops and trip reminders (if enabled).</li>
      <li>To diagnose and fix bugs when you submit feedback.</li>
      <li>To improve the app based on aggregated, anonymized usage patterns.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We use the following third-party services to operate the app:</p>
